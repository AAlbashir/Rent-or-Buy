## Project Title: *Rent or Buy Financial Calculator*

### Description of the Problem

> The decision to rent or buy a home is one of the most significant financial decisions individuals make. This decision often involves complex financial, personal, and situational factors, which can be overwhelming for potential homeowners or renters. â€œDifferent cities experience housing market trends in distinct ways, influenced by local culture, economic conditions, and policies ([Homesight.org](https://homesight.org/housing-market-trends-in-major-cities-around-the-world/), 2024). Significant volatility in sales and affordability, as well as significant shifts in mortgage interest rates and real property prices, are some of the challenges facing the global housing market ([Statista](https://www.statista.com/topics/5466/global-housing-market/#editorsPicks), 2025). Our project aims to develop a calculator that provides tailored advice on whether renting or buying a home is a better financial choice for a specific customer in a specific city. By considering various factors, such as housing prices, rental rates, and additional costs, the calculator will offer clear, data-driven insights to simplify this decision-making process.

#### Challenges

1. Technical Challenge
    > Availability of Data Online: Accurate, up-to-date data for housing prices, rental rates, and other financial variables for different cities may be challenging to access or may require integrating multiple data sources.
2. Process Challenge
    > Time Zone Differences: With team members located in different time zones, scheduling synchronous meetings and real-time collaboration could be difficult.
3. Team Composition Challenge
    > Limited Programming Skills: Neither team member has advanced programming expertise, which could hinder progress in implementing technical features.

#### Communication Plan

> To ensure effective teamwork and communication, we plan to utilize Slack for daily communication and progress updates. For deeper collaboration and planning, we will schedule regular Zoom meetings, accomodating both time zones. To manage tasks and deadlines, we will use a shared project management tool (e.g., Github). We also aim to divide the work based on individual strengths and interests, with regular check-ins to provide support where needed.

#### Branching Strategy
 * New features and bug fixes will use feature branches.
 * Feature branches will be reviewed and merged into the main branch using pull requests.
