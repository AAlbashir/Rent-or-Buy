# Project Title: *Rent of Buy Financial Calculator*  

*This is a repository for the group project of CAS 502*

### Team Members: Jeremy Roy & Abdallah Albashir

## Description of the Problem

> The decision to rent or buy a home is one of the most significant financial decisions individuals make. Our project aims to develop a calculator that provides tailored advice on whether renting or buying a home is a better financial choice for a specific customer in a specific city. By considering various factors, such as housing prices, rental rates, and additional costs, the calculator will offer clear, data-driven insights to simplify this decision-making process.
